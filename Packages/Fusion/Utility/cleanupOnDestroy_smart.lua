--[[
	The 'smarter' version of `cleanupOnDestroy` - this attempts to match the
	results from the 'dumber' polling-based version by using events to reduce
	processing.

	I'd like to improve this technique in the future - it breaks in a fair few
	edge cases right now, so in the interest of stability I don't want to adopt
	it yet.
