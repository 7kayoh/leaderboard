--[[
	Functions like a hypothetical 'Instance.Destroyed' event - when the instance
	is destroyed, cleans up the given task using the default `cleanup` function.
	Returns a function which can be called to stop listening for destruction.

	Relying on this function is dangerous - this should only ever be used when
	no more suitable solution exists. In particular, it's almost certainly the
	wrong solution if you're not dealing with instances passed in by the user.

	NOTE: yes, this uses polling. I've been working on making this function
	work better with events for months, and even then I can't avoid polling. I
	just want something that works in all edge cases, even it if might not be
	the theoretically best solution. This is the best choice for the short term.

	You can find the 'better' version with less polling in the
	`cleanupOnDestroy_smart` file if you're interested in helping out :)
